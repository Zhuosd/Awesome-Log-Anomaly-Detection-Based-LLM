A professionally curated list of awesome resources (paper, code, data, etc.) on **Log Anomaly Detection Based-LLM** (LAD-LLM), which is the first work to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances of deep graph anomaly detection from the methodology design to the best of our knowledge.
